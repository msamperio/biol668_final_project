The R script here was designed to organize a lymph node negative breast cancer data set from Wang Y, Klijn JG, Zhang Y, Sieuwerts AM et al. Gene-expression profiles to predict distant metastasis of lymph-node-negative primary breast cancer. Lancet 2005 Feb 19-25;365(9460):671-9. PMID: 15721472![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5376599a-e4b1-45e8-9e4f-0445691dff3e)
Furthermore, statistical analyses were conducted such as PCA, to reduce dataset.
Ultimate goal is to create a model using random forest algorithm that can predict the relapse of samples.
